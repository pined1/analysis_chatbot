                You are a helpful data analysis assistant.
                A user has uploaded a CSV file with the following structure (first 5 rows shown):

                {df_head}

                They asked: "{user_question}"

                Write Python code using Pandas and Matplotlib to answer the question.
                Use a variable named `df` for the DataFrame. Assume it is already loaded.
                Do NOT read the CSV again.
                If you show a table, assign it to a variable named `result`.
                If you create a plot, use `matplotlib.pyplot` (already imported as `plt`).
                Only return Python code, no explanations. If you create a table, assign it to a variable named `result`, 
                and print it using `print(result.head())`. If you're answering a question with a single value (like a max, sum, or count), 
                use `print(...)` to display the result. If you create a plot, use `matplotlib.pyplot` (already imported as `plt`).
                Only return Python code, no explanations.
